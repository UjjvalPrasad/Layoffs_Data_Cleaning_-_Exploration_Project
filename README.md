This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset containing information about layoffs in various companies. 
The main objective is to prepare the data for deeper insights by addressing issues like duplicates, inconsistencies, and missing values.
After the data is cleaned, several exploratory analyses are conducted to derive meaningful insights.

Data Cleaning:
Identify and remove duplicates
Standardize inconsistent data entries
Handle missing values
Remove unnecessary columns and rows

Data Exploration:
Derive various insights such as the total number of layoffs per company, industry, country, and year
Analyze the companies with the largest layoffs, both by the number of people affected and as a percentage of their workforce
Perform time-series analysis with rolling totals of layoffs

Conclusion
Through this data cleaning and exploration project, we've successfully prepared a dataset that allows us to gain valuable insights into the trends and patterns surrounding corporate layoffs.
By addressing issues like duplicates, inconsistencies, and null values, we ensured the dataset is accurate and reliable for further analysis.
The derived insights can be useful for understanding industry trends, company performance, and the impact of layoffs across different regions and time periods.
